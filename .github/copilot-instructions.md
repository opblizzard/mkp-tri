# MKP-TRI Copilot Instructions

This workspace is for the MKP-TRI dashboard and codex, built with Astro, Tailwind, Flowbite, and Cloudflare Pages.

- Use '.' as the project root for all operations.
- All main pages and components must be mobile-friendly, glassmorphic, and interactive.
- Headers should be movable (hide on scroll) and all panels should use responsive, rounded, transparent glass styles.
- Use Flowbite and Alpine.js for interactivity and dashboard widgets.
- All deployments go to Cloudflare Pages.

Documentation and README must always reflect the latest site features and structure.
